# DFS S3 binder

The recommended production binder for AWS S3 and S3-compatible services such as MinIO, OSS, COS, and LocalStack.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.loadup-cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>loadup-components-dfs-binder-s3</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

```yaml
loadup:
  dfs:
    binder-type: s3
    binder.s3.bucket: loadup-files
    binder.s3.region: us-east-1
    binder.s3.endpoint: https://s3.amazonaws.com
    binder.s3.access-key: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
    binder.s3.secret-key: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
    binder.s3.path-style-access-enabled: false
```

The binder persists filename and custom metadata in S3 object metadata, generates presigned GET URLs, and supports initiate/upload-part/complete/abort multipart operations. The bucket and credentials are external infrastructure; `create-bucket` is intended for development only.
